# Fell Race Finder - API

This is a quick boilerplate instructing how configure TypeScript to work with Koa et al.

## To use:

1. Clone:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/blairg/fellrace-finder-server.git`

2. `yarn` install:

  `$ cd fellrace-finder-server && yarn`

  This will also install the TypeScript definitions used in this project.

3. To run the development server, run:

  `$ yarn dev-server`

  This uses `ts-node` to transpile on-the-fly and probably ain't the best idea for production.

4. To build for production, run:

  `$ yarn run build`

  ... Which can then be started with:

  `$ yarn start`

  Included is a Procfile that will do this for you on Heroku.
